  "about": "Felix is a computer scientist based in Germany. His unconventional story began at an early age coding games and other programs in his small bedroom at his parents place. For him coding was always a zen-like experience. Later he moved to Constance to pursue his passion for discovering and learning new ideas. While exploring the scientific horizon at the university, Felix still tried to find new experiences to stay open minded. He joined theater groups, grabbed every opportunity to volunteer and dig deep into literature. His interests in other fields are often reflected in his work. Felix´s work focuses on bringing life into digital experiences by incorporating emotional intelligence and scientific thinking.",

Because these abysses function like a magnifier: You discover things which remained misunderstood before but now will be seen most sharply. So, what about this higher education system? How does a chairman of the examination board feel when he can’t allow a student to continue his studies anymore? What does a psychologist say about that? How to keep yourself awake? AND what happens when suddenly one’s imagination is cracking up and a weapon comes into play?"

They dominate life and also hold a 600 years old public dispute.<br></br>On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the thermal bath in Constance, the Amman family hosts a philharmonic charity concert to advertise one of their long-desired project: a concert hall for Constance. No question, once and for all the Amann family wants to make clear that they have the power and influence in their time-honored town.</br></br>Naturally, the Moosbruggers are not about to accept this. They go on the warpath and try hard to disrupt the event with everything they got. Their stance on a new concert hall is clear: Who needs a concert hall in this crowded town if we could spend the money for more living space?!</br></br>Roman, a young man from the Mossbrugger family and Julia from the Amann family are meeting at the charity event inside the thermal bath. Both, having no clue who they are facing, passionately fall in love with each other not knowing that the feud of their families is dominating the evening."
